"""
Fake the Kaybee/Sphinx API.

Sphinx's templating API is messy, with tons of historical layers and 
indirections. Kaybee flattens all of that, along with its own features, 
into one place.

When writing a theme, we don't want the real Kaybee API, as we don't 
want Sphinx etc. until we have to. So let's make a fake instance of 
the Kaybee API.
